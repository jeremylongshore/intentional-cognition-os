## Dependency Spine

```
E1 ──► E2 ──► E3 ──┬──► E4 ──┬──► E5 ──► E6 ──► E7 ──► E8 ──┬──► E9 ──► E10
                    │         │                                │         ▲
                    └─────────┘                                └─────────┘
                  (E4 needs E2+E3)                          (E9 needs E6+E7+E8)
                                                             (E10 needs all)

### Epic-Level Dependencies

| Epic | Depends On |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | — (root) |
| 2 | E1 |
| 3 | E2 |
| 4 | E2, E3 |
| 5 | E3, E4 |
| 6 | E5 |
| 7 | E6 |
| 8 | E7 |
| 9 | E6, E7, E8 |
| 10 | E9 (transitively all) |

## Critical Path (Longest Dependency Chain)

```
E1-B01 (frontmatter schemas)
  → E2-B05 (shared types with Zod)
    → E3-B04 (source registry + hashing)
      → E5-B05 (ingest pipeline)
        → E6-B02 (summarize pass)
          → E6-B03 (extract pass)
            → E7-B01 (FTS5 search)
              → E7-B05 (ico ask)
                → E8-B01 (report render)
                  → E9-B06 (research orchestrator)
                    → E10-B11 (v1 gate)
```

This traces the core operating loop: **schema → types → state → ingest → compile → search → ask → render → research → release**.

---

## Package Structure

```
packages/
  types/       — Shared TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas
  kernel/      — Deterministic substrate: workspace, state, mounts, provenance, traces, tasks
  compiler/    — Probabilistic layer: adapters, compiler passes, ask flow, render, agents
  cli/         — Commander.js CLI: all ico commands
```

Uses `packages/` prefix for pnpm workspace convention (standard monorepo practice).

---

## Parallelization Opportunities

### Epic 1 (16 beads)
B00-B07, B13, B14, B15 have **no internal dependencies** — can be done in parallel across sessions.

### Epics 3 + 4 (after E2)
E3-B01 (workspace) and E3-B09 (audit log) have no intra-E3 deps beyond E2. Can start immediately after E2.

### Within any epic
Most epics have 4-6 beads that can start as soon as the epic's prerequisites are met. Only integration tests and reviews require all prior beads.

---

## Recommended Execution Order

### Start with Epic 1
Every later epic references standards from Epic 1. Starting implementation before schemas and conventions are locked risks rework. Epic 1's parallel beads (B00-B07, B13, B14, B15) provide natural session boundaries.

### Then Epic 2
Repo foundation is purely mechanical — package scaffolding, tooling config. Low risk, high unlock value.

### Then Epics 3 + 4 (overlap possible)
E3 builds the kernel (deterministic substrate). E4 needs E3 complete for real commands, but E4-B01 (command router) and E4-B06 (output formatting) can start from E2 alone.

### Then Epic 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 (sequential)
Each builds on the previous. This is the core implementation chain.

### Then Epic 9
Multi-agent research and recall. Highest complexity, highest API cost.

### Finally Epic 10
Hardening, evals, release gate. Only after all features exist.

## Post-Audit Revision (2026-04-05)

A 6-auditor review (architecture, security, risk/dependency, test strategy, product management, doc consistency) identified 53 findings across CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity. All findings were addressed:

**Structural fixes:**
- ~75 cross-epic bead-to-bead dependencies wired (previously only intra-epic + epic-level)
- 3 new beads added: E1-B15 (security+scope standards), E4-B11 (trace inspection), E8-B11 (unpromote)
- Total beads: 114 → 117

**Security hardening (woven into existing beads):**
- Prompt injection defense in E1-B09, E6-B01, E6-B02
- API key redaction in E2-B11, E2-B12, E3-B06
- SQL injection prevention in E1-B05
- Path traversal/symlink defense in E5-B05
- Audit trail integrity (hash chain) in E1-B03, E3-B06
- Dependency supply chain audit in E2-B10

**Architecture fixes:**
- Entity pages added to E6-B03 (Extract pass produces concepts + entities)
- Task lifecycle expanded to 7 states in E1-B02
- Builder agent role documented as absorbed into orchestrator + E8 render pipeline
- Compile pass ordering specified in E6-B08
- Concurrency policy (WAL + lockfile) added to E1-B02, E3-B02

**Test strategy improvements:**
- Cross-package integration test requirement in E1-B07
- Fixture tier system (raw, compiled, task, eval) in E1-B07
- Deterministic quality guards in E6-B12 (run in CI without API key)
- Non-interactive test modes for E5-B07 and E9-B09
- Corruption recovery tests in E3-B10
- Regression checkpoint: "all prior integration tests pass" in every epic exit criteria

**Doc consistency fixes:**
- Terminology drift fixed: "semantic memory" → "semantic knowledge" in CLAUDE.md and README.md
- 5-stage operating loop restored in README.md
- `packages/` paths updated in CLAUDE.md component table
- Missing blueprint and execution plan references added
