## 1. Thesis

Intentional Cognition OS is a knowledge operating system.

It ingests raw source material, compiles that material into structured semantic knowledge, reasons over that knowledge through agent workflows, renders durable artifacts, and strengthens human understanding through recall-aware loops.

**Compile knowledge for the machine. Distill understanding for the human.**

This is not chat-with-docs, not a wiki generator, not RAG-with-branding, not a generic agent shell. It is a system where raw files become compiled knowledge, hard questions become scoped research operations, and answers become durable assets that compound over time.

---

## 2. Operating Loop

The product is one loop:

```
ingest → compile → reason → render → refine
```

| Stage | What happens | Owner |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Ingest** | Collect raw sources into corpus storage. Preserve provenance. | Deterministic |
| **Compile** | Transform sources into structured semantic knowledge. | Probabilistic (model proposes, system stores) |
| **Reason** | Answer questions or conduct scoped research over compiled knowledge. | Probabilistic |
| **Render** | Produce durable artifacts — reports, slides, charts, briefings. | Probabilistic |
| **Refine** | Lint knowledge, test recall, promote useful outputs, improve the base. | Both |

This loop is stated once. Everything else in this document is an elaboration of how each stage works, where the boundaries are, and what the system stores.

---

## 3. Product Shape

Three operating surfaces under one identity.

**Local mode.** Runs on a laptop against local files. Personal research vaults, private analysis, sensitive source work. No infrastructure required. This is the primary surface for Phases 1-4.

**Remote mode.** Hosted or self-hosted service for teams. Shared corpora, collaborative research, org memory. Planned for Phase 5.

**Repo-native mode.** The repository itself is the operating environment. Source-controlled knowledge, auditable outputs, repeatable agent workflows. Works in both local and remote contexts.

All three surfaces share the same workspace layout, CLI vocabulary, and architectural layers. The difference is where the data lives and who can access it.

---

## 4. Differentiators

### 4.1 Knowledge compilation

The system does not index content. It compiles it.

Compilation produces structured outputs: source summaries, concept pages, topic pages, entity pages, backlinks, contradiction notes, and open-question files. The compiled knowledge layer is the semantic intermediate representation of the corpus — analogous to object code produced from source files.

### 4.2 Semantic filesystem

Knowledge is mounted and operable, not hidden in a vector blob.

Operations like `mount`, `index`, `compile`, `lint`, `diff`, and `inspect` expose the knowledge layer as a filesystem-like substrate. Users can see what was compiled, from what sources, at what time, and trace any derived output back to its origin.

### 4.3 Episodic research workspaces

Hard questions create temporary, scoped task environments.

Each research task gets its own workspace with evidence, notes, drafts, critiques, and outputs. Multiple agents can work a single task. When the task completes, durable value is promoted and temporary work is archived.

### 4.4 Recall-aware cognition

The system supports both machine retrieval and human retention.

Machine-facing knowledge is optimized for context efficiency, linkage, and structured reuse. Human-facing knowledge is optimized for recall, understanding, and transfer — flashcards, quizzes, spaced repetition, weak-area tracking. These are two distinct output layers from the same compiled base.

### 4.5 Audit-first operation

Every meaningful event leaves a trace: ingestion, compilation, retrieval hits, task creation, promotion decisions, policy checks, eval results. This is required for trust, debugging, and quality control.

---

## 5. Architecture

### 5.1 Six-layer stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  L6  Audit & Policy    (deterministic)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L5  Recall            (human-facing)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L4  Artifacts         (durable outputs)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L3  Episodic Tasks    (temporary)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L2  Semantic Knowledge (compiled)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L1  Raw Corpus        (source-of-truth)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**L1 — Raw Corpus.** Source-of-truth inputs. PDFs, articles, papers, repos, notes, transcripts, datasets. Append-only. Never modified after ingestion. Stored in `workspace/raw/`.

**L2 — Semantic Knowledge.** Compiled markdown derived from L1. Source summaries, concept pages, topic pages, entity pages, backlinks, contradiction notes, open questions, semantic indexes. Recompilable — can be regenerated from L1 at any time. Stored in `workspace/wiki/`.

**L3 — Episodic Tasks.** Temporary scoped workspaces created for complex questions. Each task has evidence, notes, drafts, critiques, and output directories. Created on demand, archived on completion. Stored in `workspace/tasks/<task-id>/`.

**L4 — Artifacts.** Durable rendered outputs. Markdown reports, Marp slides, charts, briefings, study materials. Promotable to L2 under explicit rules. Stored in `workspace/outputs/`.

**L5 — Recall.** Human retention materials. Flashcards, quizzes, spaced repetition decks, weak-area reports. Generated from L2, adapted based on test results. Stored in `workspace/recall/`.

**L6 — Audit & Policy.** Deterministic control layer. Provenance logs, task traces, policy decisions, promotion history, eval results. Append-only. Stored in `workspace/audit/`.

### 5.2 Data classification

Every piece of data in the system has exactly one classification:

| Classification | Definition | Examples | Lifecycle |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Canonical** | Source-of-truth inputs that the system never modifies | Raw corpus files (L1) | Append-only, never mutated |
| **Compiled** | Derived from canonical sources via compilation | Wiki pages, summaries, concept pages (L2) | Recompilable from L1 |
| **Ephemeral** | Temporary working data scoped to a task | Evidence folders, drafts, critiques (L3) | Archived or pruned after task completion |
| **Durable** | Rendered outputs intended for reuse | Reports, slides, briefings (L4) | Permanent unless user deletes |
| **Adaptive** | Generated from compiled knowledge, modified by feedback | Flashcards, quiz results, retention data (L5) | Updated based on recall performance |
| **Audit** | System events and policy decisions | Traces, provenance, promotions (L6) | Append-only, never mutated |

### 5.3 Deterministic vs probabilistic boundary

This is the most important architectural constraint.

**Deterministic side** (system-owned logic):
- File storage and workspace layout
- Mount registry
- Task state machine (created → active → completed → archived)
- Provenance chain (source → compiled → rendered)
- Policy enforcement
- Promotion rules
- Audit log writes
- Eval execution
- Lifecycle transitions

**Probabilistic side** (model-driven logic):
- Summarization
- Concept extraction
- Topic synthesis
- Contradiction detection
- Question decomposition
- Artifact drafting
- Recall item generation

**Rule:** The model proposes content. The deterministic system owns state, provenance, policy, and lifecycle. The model never writes directly to audit, policy, or promotion tables.

---

## 6. The Compiler

The compiler is the core differentiator. It transforms raw corpus into structured semantic knowledge through defined passes.

### 6.1 Compilation passes

| Pass | Input | Output | Description |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Summarize** | Raw source file | Source summary page | Extracts key claims, methods, conclusions, metadata |
| **Extract** | Source summaries | Concept pages | Identifies discrete concepts, defines them, cites sources |
| **Synthesize** | Multiple source summaries + concepts | Topic pages | Cross-source synthesis on a named topic |
| **Link** | All compiled pages | Backlink annotations | Adds bidirectional references between related pages |
| **Contradict** | Source summaries + topic pages | Contradiction notes | Flags claims that conflict across sources |
| **Gap** | All compiled knowledge | Open-question files | Identifies referenced-but-undefined concepts, missing evidence |

### 6.2 Compilation triggers

| Trigger | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `ico compile sources` | Runs Summarize pass on all uncompiled sources |
| `ico compile topic <name>` | Runs Synthesize + Link for a named topic |
| `ico compile concepts` | Runs Extract + Link across all summaries |
| `ico compile all` | Runs all passes in order |
| Source re-ingested (hash changed) | Marks existing summary stale, queues recompilation |
| `ico lint knowledge` | Runs Contradict + Gap passes, reports findings |

### 6.3 Staleness model

A compiled page is **stale** when:
- Any source it was derived from has been re-ingested with a different content hash
- A new source has been added that matches the page's topic or concepts
- A dependent page (backlinked) has been recompiled since this page was last compiled

Stale pages are flagged by `ico lint knowledge` and queued for recompilation by `ico compile all`.

---

## 7. Promotion Rules

Promotion is the act of filing a durable output (L4) back into the semantic knowledge layer (L2).

### 7.1 Rules

1. Only artifacts in `workspace/outputs/` are eligible for promotion.
2. Promotion requires an explicit command: `ico promote <path> --as <type>`.
3. The `--as` flag specifies the target type: `topic`, `concept`, `entity`, or `reference`.
4. Promoted content is copied (not moved) to `workspace/wiki/<type>/`.
5. The promotion event is logged in `workspace/audit/promotions/` with source path, target path, timestamp, and actor (user or system).
6. Promoted pages enter the normal compilation lifecycle — they can be linked, contradicted, and linted.
7. Automatic promotion is never allowed. Promotion is always explicit.

### 7.2 Anti-patterns

- Promoting raw task drafts (use only final outputs)
- Promoting without review (promotion is a quality gate, not a shortcut)
- Promoting ephemeral evidence (evidence stays in L3, only synthesis goes to L2)

---

## 8. Multi-Agent Research

For complex questions, the system creates a scoped research workspace and assigns agent roles.

### 8.1 Task lifecycle

```
created → collecting → synthesizing → critiquing → rendering → completed → archived
```

### 8.2 Agent roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Collector** | Gathers relevant evidence from L2 into `tasks/<id>/evidence/` |
| **Summarizer** | Distills evidence into working notes in `tasks/<id>/notes/` |
| **Skeptic** | Challenges conclusions, flags weak evidence, writes `tasks/<id>/critique/` |
| **Integrator** | Synthesizes final answer from notes + critiques |
| **Builder** | Renders final artifact (report, slides, etc.) to `tasks/<id>/output/` |

### 8.3 Task completion

When a research task completes:
1. Final artifact is copied to `workspace/outputs/`
2. Task workspace is archived (retained but no longer active)
3. User may promote the artifact to L2 via `ico promote`
4. Task trace is closed in `workspace/audit/traces/`

---

## 9. Recall Model

The recall layer helps the human retain what the machine compiled.

### 9.1 Machine knowledge vs human knowledge

| Dimension | Machine-facing (L2) | Human-facing (L5) |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Optimized for | Retrieval, context efficiency, linkage | Recall, understanding, transfer |
| Format | Structured markdown with frontmatter | Flashcards, quizzes, explanations |
| Updates | Recompiled from sources | Adapted from test results |
| Audience | Agents and retrieval pipelines | The user |

### 9.2 Recall operations

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ico recall generate --topic <name>` | Generates flashcards and quiz questions from compiled knowledge on that topic |
| `ico recall quiz` | Runs an interactive quiz session |
| `ico recall weak` | Shows concepts with lowest retention scores |
| `ico recall export --format anki` | Exports to Anki-compatible format |

### 9.3 Feedback loop

Quiz results update retention scores per concept. Low-scoring concepts are:
- Surfaced by `ico recall weak`
- Prioritized in future `ico recall generate` runs
- Optionally flagged for recompilation with simpler language

## 10. CLI

```bash
ico init <name>                         # Initialize workspace
ico ingest <path> [--type TYPE]         # Ingest source material
ico mount <path> --name NAME            # Register corpus mount
ico compile sources                     # Compile source summaries
ico compile topic <name>                # Compile topic page
ico compile concepts                    # Extract concept pages
ico compile all                         # Run all compilation passes
ico ask <question>                      # Query compiled knowledge
ico research <brief>                    # Create research workspace
ico render report --task ID|--topic N   # Generate markdown report
ico render slides --task ID|--topic N   # Generate Marp slides
ico lint knowledge                      # Run health checks
ico recall generate --topic <name>      # Generate recall material
ico recall quiz                         # Run recall quiz
ico promote <path> --as <type>          # Promote output to L2
ico status                              # Show workspace state
ico eval run                            # Run evaluation specs
```

The CLI should feel operational — like running a build system, not chatting with a bot.

## 12. Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Language | TypeScript, Node.js 22+ | Type safety, Claude SDK native |
| CLI | Commander.js | Conventional, battle-tested |
| State | SQLite (better-sqlite3) | Local-first, zero infrastructure |
| Traces | JSONL | Append-only, greppable |
| AI | Claude API via @anthropic-ai/sdk | Compilation and reasoning engine |
| Orchestration | Agent SDK | Multi-agent research (Phase 3) |
| Retrieval | Full-text search over compiled markdown | Simple first — no vector DB until proven needed |
| Output | Markdown, Marp, matplotlib | File-based, inspectable |
| Compatibility | Obsidian-compatible wiki output | No plugin dependency, just standard markdown |

---

## 13. What This Is Not

Do not let this collapse into:
- A coding agent (this is a knowledge system, not a code generator)
- A vector database wrapper (knowledge is compiled markdown, not embeddings)
- An Obsidian plugin (output is Obsidian-compatible, but the system is independent)
- A search bar with branding (the value is compilation, not retrieval)
- An opaque memory blob (everything is inspectable, traceable, file-based)
- A one-shot research bot (outputs are durable, research compounds)
- A shell demo pretending to be an OS (the metaphor is only valid if the operations are real: mount, compile, lint, promote, audit)

---
